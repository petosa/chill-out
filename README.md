Heuristic search over frozen network states to find an optimal sequence of freezing/unfreezing operations. We hypothesize that optimizing our freezing/unfreezing strategy will boost transfer learning performance.


Main Chill Out experiments can be run with:
```
sh task.sh
```
Network and dataset config is located in `config.json`.
